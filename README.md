# Welcome to Felipe Arrazola's personal page!

Hi! My name is Felipe Arrazola, and I'm a Software Engineer. This repo is meant to host my personal page,
as well as some interesting projects that I might need to display in a web browser. 

I currently work at Flexport as a Senior Software Engineer in the Omnichannel Inventory org.

## Harmonia
This is a small project that my son, Jesus Emiliano, is working on for his Humanities class. He needed to host
a webpage, so I created a subfolder for him to upload his work. Text and images are generated using AI (ChatGPT
helped with the text and LeonardoAI helped with the images).
